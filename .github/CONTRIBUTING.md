# Contributing to [iina-plugin-bookmarks](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to [`iina-plugin-bookmarks`](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks)! It's people like you that make this such a great community.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via [Issues](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/issues) and [Pull Requests (PRs)](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/pulls).

### Issues

[Issues](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/issues) should be used to report problems with the plugin, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an [Issue](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/issues) that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a "reaction" to relevant issues can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

[PRs](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/pulls) are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or new feature merged. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or in your Pull Request. For new features, please include a usage example.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow:

1.  Fork the [repository](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/fork) to your own Github account.
2.  Clone the project to your machine.
3.  Create a new branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name.
4.  Commit changes to the branch.
5.  Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo.
6.  Push changes to your fork.
7.  Open a [PR in our repository](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/compare) and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## Code Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Please follow the existing code style. We use Prettier for code formatting. Ensure you run `npm run format` before committing your changes.
- **Testing**: If you add new features or fix bugs, please add tests to ensure the stability of the plugin. Run tests using `npm test`.
- **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation, including the [README.md](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/blob/main/README.md) if necessary, to reflect your changes.

Common commit types include:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
