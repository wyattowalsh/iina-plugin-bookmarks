# Implement Comprehensive Bookmark Filtering

**Objective:** Enable users to filter bookmarks by multiple fields such as title, description, tags, and creation date across all UI views (overlay, sidebar, standalone window).

## Tasks
- [ ] Design filter input UI components for sidebar and standalone views.
- [ ] Implement client-side filtering logic across views.
- [ ] Ensure that filter state is decoupled from global state and updates responsively.
- [ ] Highlight matching text in results (optional).
- [ ] Test filtering logic with various bookmark datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can filter bookmarks by multiple fields in all views.
- Filtering works in combination with search and sort features.
- Filtered lists are updated reactively and accurately.
- UI does not become unresponsive on large datasets.
