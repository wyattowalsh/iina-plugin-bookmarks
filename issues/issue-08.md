# Add Configurable Keyboard Shortcuts

**Objective:** Let users assign keyboard shortcuts for common actions like add bookmark, toggle overlay, and open standalone window.

## Tasks
- [ ] Use `iina.input` or menu bindings to detect keypresses.
- [ ] Define default key bindings for core actions.
- [ ] Build UI to configure shortcuts in plugin preferences.
- [ ] Ensure shortcut actions donâ€™t interfere with native IINA bindings.
- [ ] Persist and restore user-defined shortcuts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Default keyboard shortcuts are pre-defined and discoverable.
- Users can override shortcuts via plugin settings.
- Shortcuts work consistently across IINA windows.
