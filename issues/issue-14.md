# Improve Visual Feedback for Actions and Errors

**Objective:** Provide intuitive visual indicators and feedback for user actions (save, delete, import, error) to improve user experience.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add toast notifications or status messages for key actions.
- [ ] Display error messages inline or as dialogs where appropriate.
- [ ] Use loading indicators for operations with delay (e.g. import/export).
- [ ] Style feedback elements to match IINA and macOS design.
- [ ] Write UI tests to validate feedback behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Success and error messages are visible and informative.
- User actions (e.g. saving) provide real-time visual confirmation.
- Errors do not interrupt main workflows.
