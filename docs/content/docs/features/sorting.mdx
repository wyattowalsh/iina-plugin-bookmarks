# Multi-Criteria Bookmark Sorting

The IINA Bookmarks Plugin features a comprehensive sorting system that allows you to organize bookmarks using multiple criteria with priority-based ordering, giving you precise control over how your bookmarks are displayed.

## Sorting Options

The plugin supports six different sorting fields that can be used individually or in combination:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Title" value="title">
**Alphabetical sorting (A-Z, Z-A)**
- Sorts by bookmark title using proper Unicode handling
- Case-insensitive comparison for consistent results
</Tab>

<Tab title="Timestamp" value="timestamp">
**Chronological sorting by media timestamp**
- Sorts by the time position within the media file
- Useful for organizing bookmarks by where they occur in videos
</Tab>

<Tab title="Creation Date" value="creation-date">
**Sort by bookmark creation time**
- Chronological ordering by when bookmarks were created
- Helpful for finding recently added bookmarks
</Tab>

<Tab title="Description" value="description">
**Alphabetical sorting by description content**
- Sorts by bookmark description text
- Case-insensitive for consistent alphabetical ordering
</Tab>

<Tab title="Tags" value="tags">
**Sorting by tag content**
- Concatenated tags sorted alphabetically
- Multiple tags are combined with comma separators
</Tab>

<Tab title="Media File Name" value="media-file">
**Sort by extracted filename**
- Uses cleaned filename with extension removed
- Ideal for organizing by source media file
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Single-Sort Mode

The default sorting mode provides a straightforward interface for basic sorting needs.

### Features
- **Enhanced dropdown** with all 6 sorting options
- **Direction indicators**: ↑ Ascending, ↓ Descending  
- **Quick toggle** between ascending and descending order
- **Multi-sort activation** via "⚡ Multi" button

<Callout type="info">
  Single-sort mode is perfect for quick, simple sorting tasks. Use the direction toggle to reverse the sort order instantly.
</Callout>

## Multi-Sort Mode

For advanced organization needs, multi-sort mode allows up to 3 simultaneous sort criteria with priority-based fallback.

### Key Features

1. **Priority-based ordering** with numbered indicators
2. **Up to 3 criteria** for complex sorting scenarios
3. **Individual field and direction** selectors per criterion
4. **Easy management** with add/remove controls
5. **Smooth UI transitions** for better user experience

### How Multi-Sort Works

Multi-criteria sorting uses a priority-based comparison algorithm:

```
1. Sort criteria by priority (1 = highest priority)
2. For each criterion in priority order:
   a. Apply field-specific comparison
   b. If items are not equal, use this result
   c. If items are equal, continue to next criterion
3. If all criteria result in equality, maintain original order
```

### Visual Design

- **Color-coded priority badges** with #4a90e2 blue theme
- **Numbered indicators** (1, 2, 3) show sort priority clearly  
- **Remove buttons** (✕) for individual criteria
- **Add button** for additional criteria (up to limit)
- **Compact variations** for sidebar and overlay views

## User Interface Integration

### Window View (Full-Featured)
- Complete multi-sort interface with all controls
- Visual priority indicators and management tools
- Full add/remove/modify functionality
- Detailed sort preference settings

### Sidebar View (Compact)
- Streamlined multi-sort controls optimized for narrow space
- Essential functionality preserved in compact layout
- Responsive design for smaller screens
- Quick access to most-used sort options

### Overlay View (Minimal)
- Basic multi-sort for quick access during video playback
- Context-aware defaults based on current media
- Compact dropdown interface
- Essential controls only for focused experience

## Persistent Preferences

Sort preferences are automatically saved and restored for each UI view:

### Per-View Settings
- **Overlay preferences** saved separately from sidebar/window
- **Automatic persistence** using IINA's preference system
- **Preference restoration** on plugin reload
- **Independent settings** for different use contexts

### What Gets Saved
- Current sort criteria and their priority order
- Ascending/descending direction for each criterion
- Multi-sort mode enabled/disabled state
- Recently used sort combinations

<Callout type="tip">
  **Pro Tip**: Your sort preferences are saved per UI view, so you can have different sorting setups for overlay (quick access) vs. window (detailed management).
</Callout>

## Practical Examples

### Common Sorting Scenarios

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Chronological Review" value="chronological">
**Use Case**: Review bookmarks in the order they appear in videos

**Setup**:
- Primary: Timestamp (Ascending)
- Secondary: Creation Date (Ascending)

**Result**: Bookmarks sorted by when they occur in media, with creation date as tiebreaker
</Tab>

<Tab title="Project Organization" value="project">
**Use Case**: Organize work-related bookmarks by project and importance

**Setup**:
- Primary: Tags (Ascending) 
- Secondary: Title (Ascending)
- Tertiary: Creation Date (Descending)

**Result**: Grouped by tags, then alphabetical by title, with newest first for same titles
</Tab>

<Tab title="Media Library" value="media-library">
**Use Case**: Organize by source files and content

**Setup**:
- Primary: Media File Name (Ascending)
- Secondary: Timestamp (Ascending)

**Result**: All bookmarks from same file grouped together, in chronological order within each file
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Performance Optimization

The sorting system is designed for efficiency even with large bookmark collections:

### Algorithm Optimizations
- **Efficient comparison**: Priority-based algorithm minimizes unnecessary comparisons
- **Filename caching**: Extracted filenames are cached to avoid repeated processing
- **Responsive UI**: Minimal reflow during sort operations
- **Smart defaults**: Intelligent fallback behavior for missing data

### Performance Characteristics
- **Fast sorting**: Optimized for collections of 100+ bookmarks
- **Smooth UI**: No blocking operations during sort changes
- **Memory efficient**: Minimal memory overhead for sort operations
- **Responsive feedback**: Immediate visual updates when changing sort criteria

## Advanced Features

### Filename Processing

When sorting by media file name, the system intelligently processes filenames:

1. **Extension removal**: .mp4, .mkv, etc. are stripped
2. **Separator replacement**: Dots, underscores, dashes become spaces
3. **Quality indicator removal**: 720p, 1080p, 4K, etc. are removed
4. **Source indicator cleanup**: BluRay, DVDRip, WEB-DL, etc. are stripped
5. **Codec information removal**: x264, x265, H264, etc. are removed
6. **Year removal**: Years in parentheses are stripped
7. **Proper capitalization**: Words are capitalized appropriately

### Example Transformations

| Original Filename | Processed Name |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `The.Great.Movie.2023.1080p.BluRay.x264.mp4` | "The Great Movie" |
| `TV.Show.S01E01.720p.WEB-DL.mkv` | "TV Show S01E01" |
| `documentary_film(2024).mp4` | "Documentary Film" |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|---------|
| Sort not working | Check that bookmarks have the data being sorted by |
| Slow performance | Reduce bookmark collection size or use simpler sort criteria |
| Preferences not saving | Verify IINA preferences are working correctly |
| UI elements overlapping | Try refreshing the interface or switching sort modes |

### Debug Information

For troubleshooting sort issues, enable debug mode:

```javascript
// Enable debug logging for sort operations
localStorage.setItem('bookmark-sort-debug', 'true')
```

This will log detailed information about sort operations, performance metrics, and preference handling.

## Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm

The multi-criteria sorting uses a sophisticated comparison function:

```typescript
function compareBookmarks(a: Bookmark, b: Bookmark, criteria: SortCriterion[]): number {
  for (const criterion of criteria.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority)) {
    const result = compareByCriterion(a, b, criterion);
    if (result !== 0) {
      return criterion.direction === 'desc' ? -result : result;
    }
  }
  return 0; // Equal on all criteria
}
```

### Field-Specific Comparisons

Each sorting field uses optimized comparison logic:

- **Title/Description**: `localeCompare()` for proper Unicode and locale handling
- **Timestamp/Creation Date**: Numeric comparison for precise ordering
- **Tags**: Concatenated string comparison with consistent separator handling
- **Media File Name**: Processed filename comparison with intelligent cleanup

<Callout type="note">
  The sorting system is designed to be extensible. Future versions may include additional sorting fields and custom sort expressions.
</Callout>

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for upcoming releases:

- **Drag-and-drop priority reordering**: Visual priority management
- **Custom sort orders**: User-defined sort templates and presets
- **Sort performance indicators**: Visual feedback for sort complexity
- **Additional sort fields**: Duration, file size, path depth
- **Advanced sort expressions**: Formula-based sorting with custom logic
- **Sort presets**: Save and share common sort configurations
