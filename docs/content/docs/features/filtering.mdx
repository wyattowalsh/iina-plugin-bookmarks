# Advanced Filtering & Search

The IINA Bookmarks Plugin includes powerful filtering capabilities that allow you to quickly find and organize your bookmarks using advanced search syntax, quick filter presets, and intelligent suggestions.

## Quick Start

<Callout type="info">
  **New to filtering?** Start with basic search by typing in any search box - it works like traditional search. Click "Advanced Search" to unlock powerful field-specific syntax.
</Callout>

## Advanced Search Syntax

### Field-Specific Search

Search within specific bookmark fields using the `field:value` syntax:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Title Search" value="title">
```
title:"meeting notes"
title:presentation
```
Search specifically within bookmark titles for exact phrases or keywords.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Description Search" value="description">
```
description:important
description:"project details"
```
Filter bookmarks by their description content.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Tag Search" value="tag">
```
tag:work
tag:personal
```
Filter by specific tags assigned to bookmarks.
</Tab>

<Tab title="File Path Search" value="filepath">
```
filepath:movie.mp4
filepath:*.mkv
```
Filter by file path patterns or specific filenames.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Date Search" value="date">
```
created:today
created:this-week
created:>2024-01-01
```
Filter by creation date using shortcuts or specific dates.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Boolean Operators

Combine search terms with logical operators for complex queries:

| Operator | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AND` | `tag:work AND title:meeting` | Must match both conditions |
| `OR` | `tag:personal OR tag:family` | Must match either condition |
| `NOT` | `title:video NOT tag:completed` | Must match first but not second |

#### Complex Query Examples

```
tag:work AND title:meeting NOT tag:completed
description:"project review" OR title:"weekly sync"
created:this-week AND tag:urgent
filepath:*.mp4 AND tag:favorite
```

### Date Shortcuts

Use convenient date filters for time-based searches:

| Shortcut | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `created:today` | Bookmarks created today |
| `created:yesterday` | Bookmarks from yesterday |
| `created:this-week` | Bookmarks from the past 7 days |
| `created:this-month` | Bookmarks from current month |
| `created:>2024-01-01` | Bookmarks after specific date |
| `created:<2024-12-31` | Bookmarks before specific date |

## Quick Filter Presets

### Built-in Presets

The plugin includes several pre-configured filter presets:

- **Recent** 🕒 - Bookmarks created today
- **This Week** 📅 - Bookmarks from the past 7 days  
- **Untagged** 🏷️ - Bookmarks without any tags
- **Favorites** ⭐ - Bookmarks with favorite tag
- **Need Description** 📝 - Bookmarks missing descriptions

### Custom Presets

Create and manage your own filter presets:

1. **Save Current Filter** - Save your current filter combination as a custom preset
2. **Name and Describe** - Give your presets meaningful names and descriptions
3. **Usage Statistics** - Track which presets you use most often
4. **Export/Import** - Backup presets or share them between installations

<Callout type="tip">
  **Pro Tip**: Save complex filter combinations as presets for quick access to your most common searches.
</Callout>

## Filter Analytics

- **Results Count** - Number of bookmarks matching current filters
