# Getting Started

Get up and running with IINA Plugin Bookmarks in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the plugin, ensure you have:

- **macOS** 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- **IINA** 1.3.0 or later ([download here](https://iina.io))
- Basic familiarity with IINA media player

</Callout>

## Installation

<Steps>

<Step>

### Download the Plugin

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks/releases).

Look for the `.iinaplugin` file in the release assets.

</Step>

<Step>

### Install in IINA

Double-click the downloaded `.iinaplugin` file. IINA will automatically:
- Install the plugin
- Enable it in your preferences
- Load it on next startup

Alternatively, install manually:
1. Open IINA Preferences (Cmd+,)
2. Go to the **Plugins** tab
3. Click **+** and select the `.iinaplugin` file

</Step>

<Step>

### Verify Installation

Open a video file in IINA and check the sidebar. You should see a **Bookmarks** section.

If the sidebar isn't visible:
- Press Cmd+Shift+B to toggle the sidebar
- Or go to View → Toggle Sidebar

</Step>

</Steps>

## Building from Source

For development or to use the latest unreleased features:

<Steps>

<Step>

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wyattowalsh/iina-plugin-bookmarks.git
cd iina-plugin-bookmarks
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Install Dependencies

The project uses pnpm for package management:

```bash
# Install pnpm if you don't have it
npm install -g pnpm

# Install project dependencies
pnpm install
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Build the Plugin

```bash
make build
```

This compiles TypeScript, bundles the UI, and prepares the plugin for installation.
